In the past few days I've created this website with the intent to house my portfolio — stories I've written, programming projects I've worked on and still work on, etc. It was a ton of fun to create! It involved a lot of design work which is honestly one of my favourite things to do, iterating on something until it's functional and attractive. And then I had it, I had the perfect place to house all my things, and I could link it on all the websites which previously just linked to my GitHub. That was so much nicer!

But then, once I'd finished the portfolio part, I thought it a little sad to leave it at that. So next I decided to try my hand at that whole blogging thing. Thing is — the site was written purely in HTML and CSS, and making a blog in that sounded like it would end up with *so* much duplicated HTML. My host, GitHub Pages, did actually have a solution for that, though, one I'd used before: Jekyll.

I'm gonna be honest — not a huge fan of Jekyll, nor Liquid, the HTML templating language that Jekyll relies on. However, it's all GitHub Pages supports, so it's what I have to use. (Not really interested in reimplementing my site in something more complex, you know? I want something simple to set up. Even if it's not the most convenient to use.)

Anyway, I finished the initial conversion in just a couple more days. It did come with a few nice benefits:
- Sass — Oh my god I missed you so, CSS preprocessing saves the day once more!
- Automatic RSS support — which will allow me to set up some feeds for people to subscribe to my stories! Still trying to figure out if I'm going to host my stories here though. Haven't decided yet.

Anyway, I think that's about all I've got to say at the moment. Thanks for reading! Hope to see you again soon!
