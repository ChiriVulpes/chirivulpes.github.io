		They called me the Weasel. Or, well... I called myself the Weasel, anyway. I was looking to be the next great thief of this city, one who would follow in the footsteps of, I dunno, Robin Hood or something. I'd take down this great evil which plagued us all, those rich jerks on top! And the way I'd do it would be by stealing that new magical artefact that DraCu Labs ended up with, the Necklace of Longing.

		I just had to hope I didn't stumble into some other thief that would spoil my plans!`);
