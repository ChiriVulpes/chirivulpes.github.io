		Ever since I was eleven years old, I could see magic. I tried to tell my mum that I could see it, but... She didn't believe me and pretended like magic didn't exist. And I could see it! She was clearly a witch!

		...But it didn't matter, and for the next two years she continued to hide it. Honestly? I didn't care. I already had a bad relationship with her and didn't particularly trust her. She'd always cared more about my sister, treating me... _strangely_. So no, I hid everything from her, just as she hid everything from me. Including the fact that I'd begun thinking of myself as a forgotten girl, cursed to see but not to be.
		
		Thing is, though, when my sister turned eleven, she awoke as a witch. And her awakening meant that she began going to this... private witch academy school place. And a school of magic was a school of opportunity... Perhaps I _wouldn't_ forever be cursed not to be.`);
