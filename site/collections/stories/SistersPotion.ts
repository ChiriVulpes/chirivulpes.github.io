		So much of my life was idyllic, but so little of it was what I actually wanted. I hated not being useful. I hated not being able to be a witch like my sister and my mum. But I was what I was, so instead I spent a lot of my time alone, staring out at the world, feeling completely disconnected from it. It was beautiful out there, probably... but never once could I see the colours.

		Little did I know, though... there was about to be an accident.`);
