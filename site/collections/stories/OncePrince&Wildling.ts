		Prince August of Adapiel did not like being a prince. In fact, he hated it along with nearly every single 'privilege' it gave him.
		
		But then, a surprise delegation from a country at odds with Adapiel — one with a vastly different culture, and strange magicks, too...  
		Two stars meet, one red, one blue — the colour produced is purple in hue.

		'Twas a night of fated encounters.`);
