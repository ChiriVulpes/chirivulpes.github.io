		I hated sleepovers! Whenever my sister had them it made me want to scream, hearing the talking and giggles, the house being filled with girls and stuffed animals and cute clothes.

		And even worse than that, people had a habit of rolling their eyes at me and saying “Boys.” And for some reason that made me so uncomfortable.

		But then again, even if this stuff upset me there was nothing I could do. I didn't even know why I was affected so much by it. Luckily, though, I didn’t have to — I had a sister and........ she had some ideas.`);
