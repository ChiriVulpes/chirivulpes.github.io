		Sorry, what? Those girls weren't trick-or-treaters, they were eldritch horrors from another dimension? And they weren't there for his candy, they were there for *him?!* Well, at least now he didn't have to be sad about being a boy and not getting to dress up as something cute. You win some, you lose some.

		A trans novel about finding a place where you belong... somewhere *strange*.`);
