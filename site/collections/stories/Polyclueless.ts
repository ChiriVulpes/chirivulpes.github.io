		Stephen was a very uncomfortable and anxious boy riddled with insecurities and fears. He was also best friends with a lesbian couple, and, strangely, they seemed to care about him, which was weird. What was the point of caring about someone with no redeeming qualities?
		
		Regardless, they did, and they decided to take him along with them into VR for their summer vacation. He felt so out of place when he spent time with them, so... wrong, but... VR is a chance to be someone else. A chance to escape from the reality of the body you’re stuck in outside.
		
		Stephen would take full advantage of that opportunity, and maybe, just maybe... he wouldn’t be quite so out of place after all.`);
